# **CompilerButBad**

## Instructions

### *Using an Ubuntu or similar Terminal (bash, zsh...)*

- Ubuntu Commands:  
     - *install make*    
     - *install flex*     
     - *install bison*    
     - *install gcc* 

- Download code zip file or clone Github Repo

- Navigate to the directory

- Use command `code .` to open in VSCode (ensure VSCode is downloaded and installed)



# **Running the Program**

- Make Commands:

    Use `make 1` to run the first program "Functions"    
    Use `make 2` to run the first program "Ifs"     
    Use `make 3` to run the first program "Loops"

- After each make, copy contents of "dataMIPS.asm" file to a text (or asm) file saved locally to your PC

- Open QTSpim or MARS and run the text file

- Check output from console

---

## **GOOD TO KNOW**

- Functions are declared in python syntax with keyword `func`

- Parameters are separated by whitespace instead of commas
- Strings can be printed with command  `swrite stringval` 
- All funcs must have a return type
- **All the test programs have been changed to our syntax and are stored in testPrograms 4, 5, and 6**

### Things that don't work

- We have issues declaring the same variables across different functions in MIPS, the values have been changed in the source code to make the programs work

-  Negative numbers in math
